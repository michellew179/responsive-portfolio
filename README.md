# responsive-portfolio
This is a homework assignment for Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment is to make a responsive portfolio page. As you adjust the size of your screen or if you view the page on a mobile device, such as an tablet or phone, the webpage will adjust to the screen size.

*This project is not complete, and I will return to it to rework some of the media queries so the page functions to it's maximum potential.
